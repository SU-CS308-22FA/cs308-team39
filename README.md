<h1 align="center">TFF-supported Merchandise Store For All Turkish Football Clubs</h1>

## https://cs308group39.web.app/

## Description of the project
A web app which enables the teams to display their products for sale and enables customers to buy products.

#### Problem: 
Most teams in TFFâ€™s lower divisions do not have stores and websites where they sell their merchandises.

For this reason, the fans have difficulty in reaching the merchandise of their team and clubs are not earning as much revenue as they potentially could from merchandise sales.
#### Solution:
A web app in which all clubs affiliated with TFF can sell their merchandise under one roof.

## How to use the website:

#### Customer:
Anyone can go to the website url and view the products or search them. To buy or comment on products, the user has to be logged-in. In order to be logged-in, the user can simply use the Login or Signup buttons depending on user having an account or not. After signing in, the user is able to add the products to the card and continue with puchasing.

#### Team:
A team has to change their account type with a secret security key that is provided by site administrators.
After that the team will be able to add or delete products of their team.
